**Introduction** 

This repository contains work I did at the University of Pittsburgh during the Spring of 2019 in the class CHEM 1830, Synthetic Biology, taught by Dr. William Childers in the Department of Chemistry. 

**Files** 

ðŸ“œ `iGEM Presentation/ECUST iGEM 2018 Review.pptx` 

Review of East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST) project for the 2018 International Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition. 

ðŸ“œ `Research/Microfiber Project Proposal.pdf` 

Initial proposal for semester-long research project related to Synthetic Biology that will be looking at using engineered organisms to solve the synthetic microfiber issue.   

ðŸ“œ `Research/Microfiber Project Development.pdf`

Project development/progress since beginning with more specific primary literature and usage of iGEM recognized parts to ultimately help me reach my goal to eliminate microfibers in public water.  

ðŸ“œ `Lecture/Synthetic Biology Lecture.pptx`

Lecture that I gave related to Synthetic Biology research from Dr. Pamela Silver's lab at Harvard Medical School. The research is titled, **A Synthetic System That Senses Candida albicans and Inhibits Virulence Factors**. The paper is available [here](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00457). Notes for the lecture are provided in the "Speaker Notes" section of the document. 

ðŸ“œ `Lecture/Synthetic Biology Lecture Slides.pdf`

PDF Slides from Synthetic Biology Lecture mentioned above.
